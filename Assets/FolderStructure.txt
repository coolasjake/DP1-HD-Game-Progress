Scripts: All C# scripts should go here. Once we have >10 scripts we can create sub-folders ford different categories.
Music: Any sound files.
Scenes: Any Unity Scenes.
Unity Packages: Any resource packs that were taken from the unity store.
	...DO NOT sort the package elements into folders since its important to know what is not our own work.

Resources: This is a special file in Unity which MUST be named 'Resources'.
	...Files in this folder can be acessed by unity much more easily at runtime so its good practice
	...to put prefabs and some art assets in here.
   - Visual Assets: Any art including UI, 3D models, materials, sprites and text fonts (create sub-folders if one of these is missing)
   - Prefabs: Any prefab, or object you want to save.




How Prefabs Work:
A prefab is exactly the same as a GameObject except that it is stored in the assets folder instead of a scene.
Functions like Instantiate and Spawn *can* use GameObjects within the scene, but in most cases it's better to use a prefab.
Prefabs give you flexibility when copying objects: if an object is a copy of a prefab, changes can be made on one copy and applied
...instantly to all copies by clicking on the 'overrides' tab at the top of the inspector.
Unity has also recently implemented 'inhereted' prefabs, allowing you to create children of a prefab which will be updated when the
...parent changes, but will only update copies of the child when it is changed.
